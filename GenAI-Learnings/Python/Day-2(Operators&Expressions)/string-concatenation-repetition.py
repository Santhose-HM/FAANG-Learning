# String Concatenation and Repetition


# Arthemetic Operators are  worked on



# String(Concatenation, Repetation) addition(+) and multiplcation(-)


string = 'abc '
result = string+'10'

print("The result is : ",result)

result = string*10
print("The result is : ",result)



# In integer all operators are worked
# In float all operators are worked , but remeber floor and modulus  how they work?
# In boolean all operators are worked(when we perform any arthimetic operations on the boolean it return int)
# In complex expect floor and modulus all others are worked

# Float
result = 10.5//3.1
print(result)

result = 10.5 % 3.1
print(result)


# Resultant Data type
# True + True - 2(boolean+boolean gives int)
# True + 5 -6 (boolean+ int gives int)
# 3+2.4(int+float gives float)


# bool<int<float<complex
